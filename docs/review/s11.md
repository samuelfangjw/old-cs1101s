## Arrays
An array is a data structure that stores a sequence of elements. Here are some common array operations.

```
// Initialising an array
const arr = [1, 2, 3];

// Accessing array elements
arr[0]; // Evaluates to 1
arr[1]; // Evaluates to 2

// Modifying array elements
arr[1] = 4;
arr[2] = 5; // arr is now [1, 4, 5]

// Get array length
array_length(arr); // Evaluates to 3
```

:::note
Arrays in Source follow zero-based numbering, which means that the first element of the array is index 0 not index 1.
:::

:::note
Arrays are a little weird in Source/Javascript. Unlike most other languages, the size of the array can be changed after it is initialised. If initialised with no value, the placeholder value undefined is used instead. 

```
const arr = [1];
arr[4] = 5; // arr is now [1, undefined, undefined, undefined, 5]
arr[2]; // Evaluates to undefined
array_length(arr); // Evaluates to 5
```
:::

:::important
Because of the way arrays are stored in memory, random access (accessing any element in the array) takes O(1) time.

### 2D Arrays
We can create 2D arrays as follows:

```
const matrix = [[1, 2, 3],
                [4, 5, 6],
                [7, 8, 9]];

matrix[1]; // Evaluates to  [4, 5, 6]
matrix[1][1]; // Evaluates to 5
```

## Loops
A loop is a series of instructions that repeat until a certain condition is met. Source supports *while loops* and *for loops*.

### While loops
The structure of a while loop is as follows:

```
while (condition) {
    // Do something
}
```

While the condition holds true, the instructions in the while loop will be evaluated. For example,

```
// A simple example
let counter = 0;
while (counter < 10) {
    display(counter);
    counter = counter + 1;
}
```

A more complex example:
```
// Program to buy items until you run out of money
let shop_items_price = list(5, 6, 7, 8, 9);
let money_left = 25;

while (!is_null(shop_items_price) && money_left - head(shop_items_price) > 0) {
    money_left = money_left - head(shop_items_price);
    shop_items_price = tail(shop_items_price);
}
```

### For loops
The structure of a for loop is as follows:
```
for (statement; condition; assignment) {
    // Do something
}
```

Note that the assignment is only done after the intructions in the for loop have been excecuted. The for loop is equivalent to:
```
statement;
while(condition) {
    // Do something
    assignment;
}
```

An example of a for loop:
```
// loop runs 10 times
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i = i + 1){
    display(i);
}
```

:::tip
if you initialise `i to 0` and set the condition to `i < n`, the loop will run `n` times.
:::

:::note
Though rarely used, we are not limited to numbers in for loops. For example, we can initialise a list and check if a list is null.

```
for (let xs = list(1,2,3); !is_null(xs); xs = tail(xs))  {
    display(head(xs));
}
```
:::

### Break and Continue
Break and Continue are used within loops to alter control flow.

Break is used to "jump" out of a loop.

```
/*
displays the following:
1
2
"stopping here"
*/
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i = i + 1) {
    if (i === 3) {
        display("stopping here");
        break;
    } else {
        display(i);
    }
}
```

Continue is used to skip the current iteration of the loop

```
/*
displays the following:
1
2
"skipping this iteration"
4
*/
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i = i + 1) {
    if (i === 3) {
        display("skipping this iteration");
        continue;
    } else {
        // Do nothing
    }

    display(i);
}
```
