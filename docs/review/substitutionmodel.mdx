title: "Substitution Model"
---

In the substitution model, we go through the program line by line and substitute name occurances with their values (if necessary), then evaluate the resulting expressions.

```
const x = 1;

x + 1;
```

The substitution model for the above would be as follows:

1. const x evaluated and substituted into the rest of the block

    **1** + 1;

2. evaluate primitive operation

    **2**;

## Function Application
There are two ways to evaluate function applications, Applicative Order Reduction and Normal Order Reduction. 

:::important
**Applicative order reduction** is used in Source and most other popular programming languages.
:::

```
function add_one(x) {
    return x + 1;
}

add_one(1 + 1);
```

We shall use the `add_one` function above in the sections below.

### Applicative Order Reduction
In Applicative Order Reduction, we evaluate the arguments before applying the function. 

The above function will be evaluated as follows:
1. Function `add_one` is declared.
2. The arguments are evaluated first. 1 + 1 is evaluated to the number 2.

    add_one(**2**);

3. Substitute parameters with arguments and apply function.

    **2** + 1;

    **3**;

### Normal Order Reduction
In Normal Order Reduction, we substitute parameters with arguments (without evaluating the arguments) and only evaluate when expression involving only primitive operators is obtained.

The above function will be evaluated as follows:
1. Function `add_one` is declared.
2. Substitute parameters with arguments

    **(1 + 1)** + 1;

3. Only evaluate when an expression involving only primitive operators is obtained.

    **2** + 1;

    **3**;
